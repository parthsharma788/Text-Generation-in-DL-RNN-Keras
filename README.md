# 📝Text-Generation-with-Neural-Networks
This project focuses on building a Neural Network-based Text Generator using deep learning techniques. It demonstrates how a model can learn from existing text data and generate new, coherent sequences of text based on learned patterns.

## 📚 Project Overview
Objective: Train a neural network model to generate text that mimics the style and structure of the input dataset.

Techniques Used: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers.

Frameworks: Python, TensorFlow/Keras

## 🚀 Features
Data preprocessing and sequence generation

Model architecture design with LSTM layers

Model training and text generation

Tuning sequence length, temperature, and model parameters for better generation quality

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow

Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

## 🧠 Model Architecture
Embedding Layer (optional)

LSTM Layers

Dense Layer (Output layer with softmax activation)

## ✨ Results
After training, the model can generate creative text passages that resemble the input data in tone, style, and structure. Adjusting parameters like temperature can make the generated text more or less creative.
